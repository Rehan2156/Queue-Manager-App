# QueT : An app to keep social distancing in check. Takes the queue online.

The app is called &#39;QueT&#39;. It is a online token based solution for handling long waiting queues at
shops. Recently there were many violations in social distancing of people standing in queue
when wine shops were allowed to operate.

We take the complete queue online on our app. So people can join the queue from their home
and arrive at the shop only once their token is about to arrive.

With minimum contact with strangers you can visit a shop which for example has 100 people in
the queue. Thus it is possible to follow social distancing even in such a long queue because you
arrive at the shop only when it&#39;s your turn shortly.

The shopkeeper calls in the next person from our app with the press of a button depending on
the people he can handle without compromising on social distancing.

# What's in it for customers : 👇

►Search the shop you want to visit

►Join the queue and get your token number

►Leave your home only when you are prompted that your turn will arrive shortly

►No need to wait in long queues for hours

►Thus without much contact with anyone you can purchase your items from the shop


# What's in it for shopkeepers : 👇

►Open the queue shop window from the app

►Customers will join the queue

►Call next person in individually or in a group according to token numbers just by a press of a
button

►No long waiting lines outside your shop

►Users only within an 8 km radius can join

►Thus preventing spam people from joining the queue

The motivation for this app comes from social distancing violations at wine shops all across India. Several people gathered at shops in long queues. Thus posing a health alert for COVID 19 local transmission.
